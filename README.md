👋 Hi, I’m Abdi Ibrahim, or AI for short!

👀 I’m interested in building impactful, user-friendly web applications and teaching coding through interactive, step-by-step explanations.

🌱 I’m currently learning Node.js and the MERN stack, with a focus on developing full-stack e-commerce and other large-scale projects. My goal is to create a full online course learning platform, and I plan to share my journey on my future YouTube channel!

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on JavaScript and MERN stack projects, especially in e-commerce or educational tech.
